## Overview

The Pluggables components give you insertion points to push components to other
components in an "out of tree" fashion, similar to React's `<Portal>` component.

To understand it, let's look at the architecture:

- First, we need to wrap all of our React component tree in a PluggablesProvider:

```
<PluggablesProvider>
  ...
</PluggablesProvider>
```

This Provider acts like a centralized place where "insertion points" and
"plugins to the insertion points" can be can be registered.

Now, inside the components tree of our PluggablesProvider we can insert the
"insertion points":

```
<Pluggable name="left-column" />
```

And now we can simply plug things as children to the `<Pluggable>` with a `<Plug>`
component:

```
<Plug pluggable="left-column" id="navigation">relevant nav stuff</Plug>
```

Declaring a `<Plug>` with the same id two times will make the second one (in
terms of rendering order) replace the first one.

You can also pass options to the Plugs, to enable inter-component communication:

```
<Pluggable name="block-toolbar" params={...blockProps} />
```

To use the passed params, you can do:

```
<Plug pluggable="block-toolbar" id="style">
{({options}) => {
  console.log(options);
  return <Button>Clickme</Button>
}}
</Plug>
```

You can also customize how the pluggables are rendered:

```
<Pluggable name="block-toolbar">
{(pluggables) => pluggables.map(p => <div>{p}</div>)
</Pluggable>
```
